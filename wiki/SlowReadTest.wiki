= Slow Read Denial of Service attack=

Idea is to send legitimate HTTP requests, and read responses slowly aiming to keep as many as possible connections in active state. 

Attack exploits the fact that most of modern web servers are not limiting the connection duration if there is a data flow going on, and it's possible to prolong TCP connection virtually forever with zero or minimal data flow by manipulating TCP receive window size value, reported by client to the server.
Such behavior of TCP/IP stack is described in several vulnerability reports [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS09-048.mspx MS09-048], [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4609 CVE-2008-4609], [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1925 CVE-2009-1925], [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1926 CVE-2009-1926] .
